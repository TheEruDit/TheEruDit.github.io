Travel Agency "Itchy Feet"

About Us

Established in 2010, "Itchy Feet" has grown to become a leading travel agent specialising in Lutsk. Along the way we have won a collection of tourism awards, including Travel Agent & Hotel Reservations Service of the Year in the 2019 and 2021 Product Review Awards.

There are a few things we're really proud of. Our trained consultants offer personal service to help you through the process, for a holiday that suits you. Specialising in complete holiday packages, our prices are some of the most competitive in the market with exclusive deals sourced from major industry partners.

Although we offer the convenience of an online service, experience has taught us that sometimes you just want a real person you can talk to. Enjoy the best of both worlds and book with confidence at "Itchy Feet".
